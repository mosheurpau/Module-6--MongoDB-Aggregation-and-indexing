# MongoDB Mastery: Aggregation Framework and Indexing

This guide delves into the powerful Aggregation Framework and the crucial concept of indexing in MongoDB, providing you with the tools to efficiently process and optimize your data interactions.

## 0. Introduction to the Aggregation Framework

The Aggregation Framework is a powerful toolset for data processing, allowing us to perform complex operations like grouping, filtering, and transforming data within our MongoDB collections. Think of it as a way to perform advanced analysis and reporting on our data, similar to SQL queries but with MongoDB's flexible document structure.

## 1. `$match` and `$project` Stages

* **`$match`:** Filters documents based on specified criteria, similar to the `find()` method.
    ```javascript
    db.collection.aggregate([
      { $match: { age: { $gt: 25 } } } 
    ])
    ```
* **`$project`:** Reshapes documents by including or excluding fields, similar to projection in `find()`.
    ```javascript
    db.collection.aggregate([
      { $project: { _id: 0, name: 1, age: 1 } } 
    ])
    ```

## 2. `$addFields`, `$out`, and `$merge` Stages

* **`$addFields`:** Adds new fields to documents based on existing fields or expressions.
    ```javascript
    db.collection.aggregate([
      { $addFields: { fullName: { $concat: ["$firstName", " ", "$lastName"] } } }
    ])
    ```
* **`$out`:** Writes the results of the aggregation pipeline to a new collection or overwrites an existing one.
    ```javascript
    db.collection.aggregate([
        { $match: { status: "active" } },
        { $out: "activeUsers" }
    ])
    ```
* **`$merge`:**  Merges the results of the aggregation pipeline into an existing collection.
    ```javascript
    db.collection.aggregate([
        { $match: { status: "active" } },
        { $merge: { into: "activeUsers", whenMatched: "merge", whenNotMatched: "insert" } }
    ])
    ```

## 3. `$group`, `$sum`, and `$push` Stages

* **`$group`:** Groups documents by a specified key.
    ```javascript
    db.collection.aggregate([
      { $group: { _id: "$city", count: { $sum: 1 } } } 
    ])
    ```
* **`$sum`:** Calculates the sum of numerical values within a group.
    ```javascript
    db.collection.aggregate([
      { $group: { _id: "$city", totalSales: { $sum: "$amount" } } } 
    ])
    ```
* **`$push`:** Creates arrays of values within a group.
    ```javascript
    db.collection.aggregate([
      { $group: { _id: "$city", users: { $push: "$name" } } } 
    ])
    ```

## 4. Advanced `$group` and `$project` Techniques

* Explore advanced grouping techniques, such as grouping by multiple fields or using expressions.
    ```javascript
    // Grouping by multiple fields
    db.collection.aggregate([
      { $group: { _id: { city: "$city", ageGroup: { $cond: [{ $lt: ["$age", 30] }, "young", "old"] } }, count: { $sum: 1 } } }
    ])
    ```
* Learn how to use `$project` to reshape documents in more complex ways, including renaming fields and creating calculated fields.
    ```javascript
    db.collection.aggregate([
      { 
        $project: { 
          _id: 0, 
          fullName: { $concat: ["$firstName", " ", "$lastName"] }, 
          ageCategory: { $cond: [{ $lt: ["$age", 30] }, "young", "old"] } 
        } 
      }
    ])
    ```

## 5. `$group` with `$unwind`

* **`$unwind`:** Deconstructs arrays within documents, creating separate documents for each array element.
    ```javascript
    db.collection.aggregate([
      { $unwind: "$hobbies" } 
    ])
    ```
* Combine `$unwind` with `$group` to perform aggregations on array elements.
    ```javascript
    db.collection.aggregate([
      { $unwind: "$hobbies" },
      { $group: { _id: "$hobbies", count: { $sum: 1 } } } 
    ])
    ```

## 6. `$bucket`, `$sort`, and `$limit` Stages

* **`$bucket`:** Categorizes documents into buckets based on specified boundaries.
    ```javascript
    db.collection.aggregate([
      { 
        $bucket: { 
          groupBy: "$age", 
          boundaries: [0, 20, 40, 60, 100], 
          default: "unknown", 
          output: { count: { $sum: 1 } } 
        } 
      }
    ])
    ```
* **`$sort`:** Sorts the documents in the pipeline based on one or more fields.
    ```javascript
    db.collection.aggregate([
      { $sort: { age: 1, name: -1 } } // Sort by age ascending, then name descending
    ])
    ```
* **`$limit`:** Limits the number of documents passed to the next stage in the pipeline.
    ```javascript
    db.collection.aggregate([
      { $limit: 10 } // Return only the first 10 documents
    ])
    ```

## 7. `$facet` and Multiple Pipelines

* **`$facet`:** Allows executing multiple aggregation pipelines within a single stage.
    ```javascript
    db.collection.aggregate([
      {
        $facet: {
          youngUsers: [{ $match: { age: { $lt: 30 } } }],
          oldUsers: [{ $match: { age: { $gte: 30 } } }]
        }
      }
    ])
    ```
* Use `$facet` to perform parallel processing of different aggregations on the same data.


## 8. `$lookup` Stage and Data Modeling

* **`$lookup`:** Performs a left outer join between two collections, similar to joins in relational databases.
    ```javascript
    db.orders.aggregate([
      {
        $lookup: {
          from: "users", // The collection to join with
          localField: "userId", // The field from the input documents
          foreignField: "_id", // The field from the documents of the "from" collection
          as: "user" // The output array field
        }
      }
    ])
    ```
* **Embedding vs. Referencing:** Understand the trade-offs between embedding documents and referencing them using ObjectIds.
    * **Embedding:** Store related data within the same document.
    * **Referencing:** Use ObjectIDs to reference other documents.

## 9. Indexing and Query Performance

* **Indexing:** Learn how indexing improves query performance by creating efficient data structures. Imagine an index as a sorted table of contents for your collection, allowing MongoDB to quickly locate specific documents.
* **COLLSCAN vs. IXSCAN:** Understand the difference between Collection Scan (scanning all documents) and Index Scan (using an index for efficient lookup). When a query can utilize an index, it performs an IXSCAN, which is significantly faster than a COLLSCAN.

## 10. Compound Indexes and Text Indexes

* **Compound Indexes:** Create indexes on multiple fields for efficient queries involving multiple criteria.
    ```javascript
    db.collection.createIndex({ age: 1, city: -1 }) // Create a compound index on age (ascending) and city (descending)
    ```
* **Text Indexes:**  Design indexes for efficient text searching within string fields.
    ```javascript
    db.collection.createIndex({ description: "text" }) // Create a text index on the "description" field
    ```
